# PIXEL Port Activity Scenario Modelling

This repository implements the PAS modelling presented in the MTC paper : https://www.dropbox.com/s/6z2e854bxz9jtur/MTC2019_SIMON_LACALLE.pdf?dl=0.

## Getting started

Update files in `data/` according to your port needs or leave them as they are, then start the process :

```bash
python main.py  #Â python3 or above
```

It generates a `pas.json` file containing the **Port Activity Scenario**.
